# react-project01
My first project under Udemy's Complete Guide to React and Redux.

## How to run:
< pip install npm >
< npm install react react-dom >
In the base folder, run < npm start >
It should run in localhost.

## Description:
This project is a expenses tracker with an inbuilt graph of monthly expenses, and uses useState hooks throughout to maintain states.
